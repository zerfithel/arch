Thank you for reading this and using KniVe!

FAQ:

- How can i change the command (instead of pc) to be something else?
> Just rename the file using this command:
mv /usr/local/bin/pc /usr/local/bin/new_name

- Can i edit the code and how?
> Yes, you can edit code and to see the code go to "pc" (section where you can download file) and if you want to edit the code,
> right click the script and click "Open with Text editor/Gedit/Kate" depending on text editor that you use and is set as default

- Why would i use it when pacman commands are easy?
> This script is not only for people that cannot remember pacman commands. It makes installing programs with pacman a little bit faster
 
- Will this script be updated?
> Yes! This script will be available for other commands, not just pacman. I will also make a version for Ubuntu/Debian-based Distros!
